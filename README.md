# 🚆 Railway Ticket Booking System (TOC Project)

A **Railway Ticket Booking System** developed as part of the **Theory of Computation (TOC)** curriculum.  
This project demonstrates how theoretical computer science concepts can be applied to real-world systems like ticket reservation and passenger management.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Railway Ticket Booking System** simulates the core functionalities of a real-world railway reservation platform.  
It focuses on structured input handling, validation logic, and process flow inspired by **automata and formal language concepts** from TOC.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 User authentication (basic simulation)
- 🎫 Ticket booking workflow
- 📅 Train schedule selection
- 👥 Passenger details management
- ❌ Ticket cancellation logic
- 📄 Booking confirmation display
- ⚙️ Rule-based validation inspired by TOC concepts

---

## 🧠 TOC Concepts Applied

This project integrates **Theory of Computation** principles, such as:

- **Finite State Machines (FSM)**
  - Booking states:  
    `Start → Select Train → Enter Details → Confirm → Booked`
- **Formal input validation rules**
- **Deterministic state transitions**
- **Acceptance & rejection states**

These concepts ensure correctness, predictability, and structured execution.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BaljeetkumarPatel/railway-ticket-booking-toc.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:
  ```bash
  cd railway-ticket-booking-toc
```


3. Open index.html in your browser:
   ```bash
    start index.html
   ```


## 🧪Sample Workflow

-Launch the application
-Select train and journey details
-Enter passenger information
-Validate inputs
-Confirm booking
-Display booking confirmation

Each step represents a state transition in a finite automaton.
